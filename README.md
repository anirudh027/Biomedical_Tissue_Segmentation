# Biomedical_Tissue_Segmentation


## Introduction
This repository hosts code and documentation for the seminar thesis on "Advancements in Biomedical Image Segmentation: A Comprehensive Study of U-Net Architecture and Recent Developments". The thesis explores the U-Net architecture, a seminal convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for biomedical image segmentation, and investigates its performance in various biomedical imaging challenges. Additionally, recent advancements in attention mechanisms and their integration into U-Net are explored to enhance segmentation accuracy.

##  Experiments
Experiments were conducted using the OCELOT 2023: Cell Detection from Cell-Tissue Interaction challenge dataset. Results comparing different model architectures, including U-Net, U-Net with attention mechanisms, and U-Net without skip connections, are provided.
